# The Artificial Poet: Generating poems with a character-level LSTM

Poem generated during epoch 105:

on a charred spinning wheel, the world was cold the soul of the storm, 
the shadow s soul where the strong she still, 
the stars that beautiful and strain, 
and the strange and the storm of the stars, 
and the stars of the storms of the stars, 
i say i shall be the made the stars of the storm, 
the stars when the wind of the stream of the shadow, 
the thing of the said the world was a sea, 
and the shadow of the sky
 
 Would you like to hear how that sounds?
