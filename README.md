1 on a charred spinning wheel, the world was cold the soul of the storm,

2 the shadow s soul where the strong she still, 

3 the stars that beautiful and strain, 

4 and the strange and the storm of the stars, 

5 and the stars of the storms of the stars, 

6 i say i shall be the made the stars of the storm, 

7 the stars when the wind of the stream of the shadow, 

8 the thing of the said the world was a sea, 

9 and the shadow of the sky
 

**Would you like to hear how that sounds?**
